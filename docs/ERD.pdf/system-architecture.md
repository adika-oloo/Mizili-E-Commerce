Mizili â€” System Architecture


Overview
Mizili is built as a modular backend that provides RESTful APIs for an agriculture marketplace and services ecosystem. The backend exposes endpoints for product management, user authentication, orders, market prices, weather updates, extension services, and community features such as cooperatives and reviews.


Components
- **API Server**: Django + Django REST Framework. Responsible for authentication (JWT), business logic, and data validation.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational storage (users, products, orders, services, etc.).
- **Caching (optional)**: Redis for caching market prices, weather responses, and session-related data.
- **Storage**: Cloud object storage (S3-compatible) for assets (training videos, images, PDFs).
- **Third-Party Integrations**:
- Weather API (OpenWeatherMap or similar)
- Market price feeds (custom source or partner API)
- Payment gateway (M-Pesa, Stripe, or similar depending on region)
- **Hosting**: Railway / Render / Heroku for backend and PostgreSQL hosting. Frontend hosted on Vercel or Netlify.


Data Flow
1. Client (mobile/web) calls API endpoints (HTTPS) documented in `/api/docs/`.
2. API Server authenticates requests using JWT tokens.
3. Server queries PostgreSQL (with optimized queries using `select_related` / `prefetch_related`) and optionally caches heavy-read endpoints in Redis.
4. For weather and market data, server either fetches real-time from third-party APIs or serves cached snapshots.
5. Orders trigger workflows: payment, transport assignment, and notification to involved parties.


Scalability & Reliability
- Use connection pooling for PostgreSQL (pgbouncer) when necessary.
- Introduce rate-limiting on public endpoints.
- Horizontally scale API servers behind a load balancer.
- Use background workers (Celery + Redis or RQ) for long-running tasks (sending notifications, syncing market prices, processing video transcoding).


Security
- Use HTTPS everywhere.
- Keep secrets out of source control via environment variables.
- Enable strong password hashing (PBKDF2 / Argon2) and enforce password policies.
- Validate and sanitize uploaded content.


Observability
- Logging: structured logs (JSON) shipped to a log aggregator (LogDNA, Papertrail).
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana or host-provided metrics.
- Error reporting: Sentry for exceptions.
