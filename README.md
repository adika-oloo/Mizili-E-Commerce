Mizili E-Commerce Agricultural Platform

Mizili is designed as an AgriTech marketplace that empowers smallholder farmers and rural communities, directly supporting the mission of SDG 2: Zero Hunger. By giving farmers access to real-time weather updates, localized best farming practices, affordable inputs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, tools), and digital marketplaces for selling produce, Mizili helps to:

End hunger & malnutrition (SDG 2.1 & 2.2): Mizili improves food availability by linking farmers to broader markets, reducing post-harvest losses, and increasing the circulation of nutritious produce.

Double productivity & farmer income (SDG 2.3): Farmers gain fairer prices by cutting out middlemen and accessing data-driven insights that improve crop yields.

Promote sustainable agriculture (SDG 2.4): Miziliâ€™s tailored recommendations encourage climate-smart practices, efficient water use, and soil health management.

Strengthen agricultural systems (SDG 2.A & 2.C): By connecting farmers with extension services, digital tools, and transparent pricing, Mizili contributes to more resilient local food systems.
